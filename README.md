# Algorithmic-Trading Model-using-Unsupervised-Learning
This project focuses on developing a Python-based algorithmic trading model designed to generate trading signals and optimize risk management strategies. The project employs machine learning techniques, particularly unsupervised learning, to extract insights from financial data, such as patterns and relationships that are not predefined. The approach involves clustering stocks based on various technical indicators, followed by portfolio optimization using the Efficient Frontier method to maximize the Sharpe ratio. The analysis is based on recent S&P 500 stock data, with acknowledgment of potential survivorship bias due to the dataset's limitations. Challenges include the potential for pattern recognition by other market participants, making strategies less effective, and the inherent difficulty in predicting financial markets.
This project is purely for research and should not be construed as financial advice.
